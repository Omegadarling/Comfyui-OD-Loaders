# Comfyui-OD-Loaders
The pythongosssss loaders have been broken for a little while and I missed the thumbnail previews and folder organization, so I added those thumbnails and folder structure into a few of the basic loaders.

Based on the built-in loaders and code from https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts

All I really wanted to add back in was the thumbnails when you roll over items in your list of models, making it easier to see/remember what each custom model looks like.
